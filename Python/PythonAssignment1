## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?

-> Python is alson one of the general purpose programming language because its used in multiple ways across multiple os, and multiple hardware.
-> Also it is high-level programming language, as most of its code are in human readable form not like a machine code.

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?

-> In other programming languages, we have to declare variable type, but in python we dont have to explicitly mention its data type, it automatically
   recognizes it.

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?

-> some of the pros are: 
	1) it is begginer friendly
	2) it has more libraries
	3) it has larger community
-> some of the cons are:
	1) slower than compiled language
	2) Multithreading in python

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?

-> 1. web development, 2. Data Science, 3. hardware 4. gaming

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?

-> variable are used to store or hold object in them. As, python is statically typed, we dont have to decalre a variable type, so, we can directly
   assign a value to the variable just using assignment operator.
	ex: name = "Tim cook"

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?

-> we can take input from user in python using input() buit-in function.
	ex: name = input("Enter your name")

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?

-> by default, input function returns String.

Q8. What is type casting?

-> type casting is nothing but converting a data type to another.

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?

-> yes, it is possible, one of the way is using split()

Q10. What are keywords?

-> keywords are the reserverd words in python which have special meaning and can't be used for anything only for those special meaning.

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.

-> no, keywords, can't be used as variable. variable name have some certain rules to be followed 
	1) must start with letter or underscore, 2) can't start with number, 3) can't use keyword etc.

Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?

-> identation is structuing the code in a neat way, in other languages its just for readability, but in python it mean the block of code.

Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?

-> we can throw the output to the screen using print command

Q14. What are operators in Python?

-> operators in python are used to perform operation on variables and values.

Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?

-> / is normal divison and // is floor division which gives only integer values.

Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
```
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
```

Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.

num = int(input("Enter a number to check whether it is a even or odd \n"))
if(num % 2 == 0):
    print('Its..Even')
else:
    print("It's Odd")

Q18. What are boolean operator?
-> True and False

Q19. What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0  -> 1

0 and 0 -> 0

True and False and True -> False

1 or 0 or 0 -> 1
```

Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?

-> if, if else, nested if, if elif

Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?

-> To check conditions, and if it is true then go on with the execution of code in the block.

Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".

-> 	age = int(input("Enter Your age\n"))
	if age >= 18:
    		print("I can vote")
	else:
    		print("I can't vote")


Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```

-> numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
	sum = 0

	for i in numbers:
    		sum += i

	print(sum)


Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.

->  	numbers = input("Enter 3 numbers\n").split()
	max = 0 
	for i in numbers:
    		if max < int(i):
        	max  = int(i)
	print(max)

Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

- The number must be divisible by five

- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```

->	numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]

	for i in numbers:
    	if i > 500:
      	  break
    	elif i > 150:
        	continue
    	elif i % 5 == 0:
        	print(i)
